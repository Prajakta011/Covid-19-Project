# Covid-19-Project
The aim of the project is to provide data visualization of covid-19 (a pandemic started 
in December 2019). Through plotting of data, various cases have been studied like 
most affected countries due to this pandemic. Study of data from various countries is 
combined to show the growth of cases and recovery graph. In this project, the 
predictions on various cases has been done and finally, the accuracy of the algorithm 
has been determined. Comparison graphs has also been plotted to visualize how much 
INDIA is getting affected/recover day by day. Our objective is to predict the total 
number of cases, retrieved cases and deaths across a given set of data based on the 
concept of machine learning.
